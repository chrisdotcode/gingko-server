# Build and run instructions

Clone this repo so that it's next to the gingko/client repo:

- /your-gingko-install
  - /client
  - /server

You'll need these prerequisites:

- Bun.sh : https://bun.sh
- SQLite : https://sqlite.org/
- CouchDB : https://couchdb.apache.org/ (soon to be removed from Gingko Writer, but still needed)

```
bun i
bun run watch
```
Then visit https://localhost:3000
